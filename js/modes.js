The dome was built in 1986 thanks to donations from alumni belonging to the Rams Club. The first game played at the dome was against DOOK, you may have heard of them, and North Carolina started a long legacy of beating DOOK in the dean dome on that day.</p>   <p>Now, don't get the wrong idea, I actually opposed the dome being named after me. I also usually wouldn't talk about myself, but in the interest of history, here are a few things I did in my years at UNC: I coached at the school for 36 years, winning 879 games. The men's basketball team won 2 national championships and 13 ACC championships under my coaching. You may know some of the players I coached over the years, including: Michael Jordan, Larry Brown, James Worthy, Sam Perkins, Phil Ford, Bob McAdoo, Billy Cunningham, Kenny Smith, Walter Davis, Jerry Stackhouse, Antawn Jamison, Rick Fox, Vince Carter, Scott Williams and Rasheed Wallace. I was inducted into the basketball hall of fame in 1983.</p> <p>But I did a few important things off the court as well. There is a now popular story of the time I took one of my players out to eat. This player happened to be African-American and the restaurant happened to still enforce segregation. With me at his side, my player and I were able to enjoy a lunch together in that restaurant on that afternoon. There was also the time I invited Charlie Scott, a very talented young black man, to join the UNC men's basketball team on a scholarship. He would become known as the university's first black scholarship athlete.</p> <p>Now that's enough about me. I hope you enjoy your quest through Explorolina and, as always, go heels! Oh, and just remember while you play, if you make every game a life-and-death proposition you're going to have problems. For one thing, you'll be dead a lot. Now I'll turn you over to my good friend, Michael.</p>",

But I'm here to talk to you today about this statue you see in front of you. This is the great Silent Sam. He honors the 321 student soldiers that fought bravely for the Confederacy in our Civil War. Now, some students on campus seem to have some problems with this statue, although I don't see why. I was the one to dedicate this monument, as a matter of fact. I proclaimed in very clear terms what it represents! Like I said, the Confederacy sought to save the very life of the Anglo Saxon race in the South! We wanted to contain the purest strain of our glorious race in these 13 Southern states! In my speech I made sure to let everyone know about the time I horse-whipped a negro wench right over there on Franklin Street! How could any of that be misconstrued into something bad?? Okay, hmph, perhaps some of those things wouldn't be as 'PC' these days, but so what!
